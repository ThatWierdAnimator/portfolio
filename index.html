            <p>My love for programming is rooted in a love for making games. Ever since I was young, I loved creating and sharing games with others. This site is no different. I wanted to stand out in the endless sea of other portfolios and decided the best way to accomplish this was to make a small game. I really hope you enjoy it.</p>
